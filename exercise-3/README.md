# Exercise-2

As described in [module-4](https://github.com/INFO-201/m4-git-intro), you should begin by forking this repository, then cloning it to your local machine (if you haven't already).

In the space below, you'll provide some information about a terminal command you've learned thus far in the class. In particular, you should include the following:

A `heading` with the name of the command.<br>
An example of how it can be used (with appropriate code highlighting).<br>
A _nested list_ of information about the command (i.e., things that it does, or how it can be used)

See `complete` branch for answers.

## git commit
```
git commit
```
* Commits changes to a local git repository, use `git push` to push local changes to a remote repository.
* Adding the flag `-m` allows you to add a message when you commit:
```
git commit -m "Your message here"
```
* Adding the flag `-a` adds and commits all files in your current repository
```
git commit -a
```
* Flags can be combined, like:
```
git commit -am "Your message here"
```
